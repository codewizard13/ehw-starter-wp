ABOUT THIS FOLDER:

_SNAPS (Underscore means this is a database driven folder)

Contains "snapshots", installed versions of a website at a given point in time.

This is as opposed to bkp, which houses the ZIP archives used to generate the snap.

The inpro folder is another "live" site directory run on localhost. This is where I can take a snap and sandbox-modify it and do experiments on snaps. These can be deleted when not needed any more.

FILES NEEDED FOR A GOOD BACKUP ARCHIVE:

- Duplicator Archive & installer.php
- Screenshot of website homepage

other_dirs/

- Backup of any other folders/files in domain root (if this backup is for the primary site)

wp-content/

- Backup of wp-content folder (plugins, themes, uploads)

- Raw .db or .sql database files (where applicable)
- Any other assets needed should go in the "assets" folder (themes, plugins, etc)
